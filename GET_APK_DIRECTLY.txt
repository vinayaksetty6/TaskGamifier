2. GitHub starts automatic build (GitHub Actions)
3. Build server downloads JDK (Java Development Kit)
4. Build server downloads Android SDK

8. APK is made available for download
9. You download it
10. You copy to phone
11. Phone installs it
12. Done! 🎉

This is EXACTLY the same as building on Android Studio,
except it happens on GitHub's servers instead of your computer!
